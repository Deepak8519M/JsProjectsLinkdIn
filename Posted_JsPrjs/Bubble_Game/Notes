<!-- ***Mainly focusses on Event Bubbling*** 
 Time:13:07 

Overflow hidden concept

centre div using flex

height: calc(100% - 50px); 

here we basically cant add event listener for every bubble so we use event Bubbling concept so that we add

event listener to paretnt so that if there is any click between them the event gets generated and we use target attrb to solve the issue.-->
